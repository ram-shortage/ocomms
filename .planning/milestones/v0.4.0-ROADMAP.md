# Milestone v0.4.0: Files, Theming & Notes

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 21-23
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

v0.4.0 delivers three feature areas: dark mode theming for improved accessibility and user preference, file uploads for sharing documents and images in conversations, and markdown notes for persistent knowledge sharing in channels and personal scratchpads. Theming comes first (affects all UI), file uploads second (extends proven avatar pattern), and notes last (most new surface area).

## Phases

### Phase 21: Dark Mode/Theming

**Goal**: Users can choose between light and dark themes with their preference persisted across sessions
**Depends on**: Nothing (standalone, affects all UI)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 21-01-PLAN.md - Install next-themes, create ThemeProvider, add toggle to sidebar
- [x] 21-02-PLAN.md - Audit and fix hardcoded colors, verify all UI in both themes

**Requirements:** THEME-01, THEME-02, THEME-03, THEME-04, THEME-05

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can toggle between light and dark mode from the UI
2. Theme defaults to system preference on first visit
3. User's theme choice persists across browser sessions
4. Page loads without flash of wrong theme (no FOUC)
5. All existing UI components render correctly in both themes

### Phase 22: File Uploads

**Goal**: Users can attach files to messages in channels and DMs with visual previews for images
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (file preview components need theming)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 22-01-PLAN.md - Backend infrastructure: database schema, file validation library, upload API route
- [x] 22-02-PLAN.md - Upload UI: drag-drop zone, progress indicator, message input integration
- [x] 22-03-PLAN.md - Display components: file attachment rendering, socket integration, message display

**Requirements:** FILE-01, FILE-02, FILE-03, FILE-04, FILE-05, FILE-06, FILE-07, FILE-08, FILE-09, FILE-10

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can drag-and-drop or click to upload files up to 25MB
2. User sees upload progress indicator while file uploads
3. Image files display as inline previews in messages
4. Non-image files display as download links with filename and size
5. Files over 25MB are rejected with clear error message

### Phase 23: Notes

**Goal**: Users can create and edit markdown notes per channel and maintain a personal scratchpad
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (notes UI needs theming), Phase 22 (optional future attachment support)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 23-01-PLAN.md - Database schema for notes tables, socket event types
- [x] 23-02-PLAN.md - API routes and note editor component with markdown preview
- [x] 23-03-PLAN.md - Channel notes integration (header button, sheet, socket handlers)
- [x] 23-04-PLAN.md - Personal notes (sidebar link, notes page)

**Requirements:** NOTE-01, NOTE-02, NOTE-03, NOTE-04, NOTE-05, NOTE-06, NOTE-07

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each channel has a shared markdown document accessible from channel header
2. Each user has a personal notes scratchpad in each workspace
3. User can edit notes with markdown syntax and preview rendered output
4. Any channel member can edit that channel's notes
5. Concurrent edits trigger conflict detection with user warning

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- next-themes for theming (de facto standard, FOUC prevention)
- Extend avatar upload pattern for file uploads (proven approach)
- react-markdown for notes (XSS-safe, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- Last-write-wins with conflict detection for notes (not CRDT/OT)
- XHR over fetch for upload progress support (fetch lacks upload progress events)
- next/image unoptimized for uploaded files (not in Next.js image domains)
- Validate attachment ownership before linking to messages
- 2 second debounce for note auto-save (balance responsiveness and API load)
- Version 0 indicates new note (INSERT), version >= 1 indicates UPDATE

**Patterns Established:**

Theming:
- bg-card for content containers
- bg-muted for hover states and subtle backgrounds
- text-foreground for primary text
- text-muted-foreground for secondary text
- text-primary for links and interactive elements
- ring-card for presence indicators

File Uploads:
- validateFileSignature() for magic bytes validation (shared library)
- Attachment metadata in database, file on disk with UUID name
- messageId nullable for upload-before-send flow
- uploadFile() with progress callback and abort signal
- Staged attachments pattern for upload-before-send UI
- FileAttachment component for image preview vs download card
- formatBytes() for human-readable file sizes

Notes:
- Version column for optimistic locking conflict detection
- One note per channel via unique index on channelId
- One personal note per user per org via composite unique index
- Edit/preview toggle with mode state
- Debounced auto-save with useCallback
- Client-initiated broadcast pattern for real-time sync
- Note socket rooms: note:channel:{channelId} and note:personal:{userId}:{workspaceId}

**Issues Resolved:**

- All UI components themed correctly in light and dark modes
- File upload progress tracking via XHR (fetch API limitation)
- Concurrent note edit conflicts detected with user choice

**Tech Debt (Non-blocking):**

- vitest.config.ts TypeScript error with environmentMatchGlobs (pre-existing)
- Test file TypeScript errors in __tests__ directories (pre-existing)
- 156 lint warnings in various files (pre-existing)
- offline-queue.test.ts missing attachmentIds field (test not updated)
