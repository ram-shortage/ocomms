## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| S3/cloud storage | Local disk maintains self-hosted simplicity |
| File versioning | Complexity without clear value for chat files |
| Real-time collaborative editing | CRDT/OT complexity; last-write-wins sufficient |
| Note comments/threads | Notes are simple docs, not discussion threads |
| Theme customization | Light/dark sufficient; custom themes add complexity |
| File search | Full-text search of file contents is separate feature |
