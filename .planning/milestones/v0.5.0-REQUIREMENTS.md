## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded with reasoning.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Calendar integration for status | External service dependency, violates self-hosted principle |
| Rich presence (app/music sharing) | Privacy concerns, not relevant for work context |
| Read receipts | Privacy nightmare, user backlash |
| "Last seen" timestamps | Surveillance feeling |
| Nested channel categories | Complexity trap, Discord uses single level |
| Per-category permissions | Significant auth complexity, defer to future |
| Natural language reminder parsing | High error rate, use explicit date picker |
| Auto-play video in link previews | Bandwidth/annoyance |
| Scheduled thread replies | Odd UX, Slack doesn't support |
| Recurring scheduled messages | Workflow builder territory |
| Per-user activity leaderboards | Gamification backfire |
| Guests in user groups | Slack explicitly prevents this |
