| Phase 3 (Presence) → Phase 5 (@here filtering) | Connected |
| Phase 4 (Threading) → Phase 5 (Thread notifications) | Connected |
| Phase 5 (Notifications) → Phase 6 (Unread) | Connected |
| Phase 3 (Messages) → Phase 6 (Unread increment) | Connected |
| Phase 6 (Unread) → Phase 7 (Search exclusions) | Connected |

**Total: 12/12 cross-phase connections verified**

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Signup → Workspace → Channel → Message | Complete |
| @mention → Notification → Bell display | Complete |
| Reply → Thread → All Threads page | Complete |
| Add reaction → Realtime update → Other users see | Complete |
| New message → Unread count → Auto-clear on view | Complete |
| Search → Permission-filtered results → Navigate to source | Complete |
| Docker compose up → All services healthy → Full functionality | Complete |

**Total: 7/7 flows verified**

## Tech Debt

Minor UI polish items (not blocking):

| Phase | Item |
|-------|------|
| UI Polish | Missing sidebar navigation link for /threads page |
| UI Polish | Missing sidebar navigation link for /search page |

Both pages are fully functional and accessible via URL. Navigation links would improve discoverability.

## Anti-Patterns Found

None. All phases verified with no TODO/FIXME comments, no placeholder stubs, no empty returns in production code.

## Conclusion

The "Full Conversation" milestone has achieved its definition of done:

1. **Conversation Structure** - Channels, DMs, threads, pins all implemented
2. **Findability** - Full-text search with permission filtering
3. **Attention Management** - Unread counts, notifications, channel settings
4. **Acknowledgment** - Emoji reactions with real-time updates
5. **Self-Hosted** - Docker deployment with backup/restore/export

The platform delivers a complete Slack-like communication experience that organizations can self-host with full data sovereignty.
