  <what-built>
Phase 24 implements three independent features:
1. Typing indicators - real-time "[Name] is typing..." display
2. Channel archiving - read-only channels in "Archived" sidebar section
3. Channel categories - collapsible groups with drag-drop organization
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Typing Indicators (TYPE-01 to TYPE-05):**
1. Open app in two browser tabs as different users
2. Start typing in one tab - other shows "[Name] is typing..."
3. Stop typing - indicator disappears after ~5 seconds
4. Send message - indicator clears immediately
5. Type rapidly - network tab shows max ~1 event per 3 seconds

**Channel Archiving (ARCH-01 to ARCH-06):**
1. Go to a channel's settings (not #general)
2. Click "Archive Channel" - confirm
3. Channel disappears from main list
4. Expand "Archived" section at bottom - channel appears
5. Navigate to archived channel - see "archived" banner
6. Try to send message - should be blocked
7. Search for message in archived channel - should find it
8. Unarchive the channel - returns to main list
9. Try to archive #general - should show error

**Channel Categories (CCAT-01 to CCAT-06):**
1. As admin, create a category (e.g., "Engineering")
2. Drag a channel into the category
3. Click category header to collapse - channel list hides
4. Collapsed category shows unread count badge (if messages exist)
5. Uncategorized channels appear in "Channels" section
6. As non-admin user: categories visible, collapse works, but no drag handles
7. Refresh page - collapse states persist

**Integration:**
1. Archive a channel that's in a category - should move to Archived section
2. Typing indicators work in archived channels (viewing history, indicator still shows)
3. All three features visible in sidebar without visual conflicts
